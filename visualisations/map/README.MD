The map consists of a static webpage built using Leaflet.js.
The map can be deployed on the web using a web server such as Nginx or Apache.

To run locally on Unix systems, just download the code and from the terminal run:
```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

To open the map, go to http://localhost:8000.
