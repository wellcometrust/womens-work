The rate of mortality of females following industrial occupations cannot be estimated, nor yet, fairly, the average age at death, in consequence of the imperfection of the mortuary returns, which in the instance of married women do not in all cases specify the occupation followed. The particulars as to the cause of death, as given in Table XIV., are open to fewer crbjections on this score. Dressmakers and Milliners appear to die to a large extent from consumption, 42 per cent, of the deaths being attributable to this cause. There is no difficulty in associating this with the damage inflicted upon the health from excessive and late hours of work in close, crowded, and confined rooms, together with deficient bodily exercise.

Female labour is on a very unsatisfactory footing— young women living at home with their parents, certainly earn wages which contribute partly to their maintenance ; some married women work far below the fair value of labour to supplement the wages of a husband whose work is casual and uncertain, often from drunkenness ; female labour even attempts to compete with manufacturing establishments ; some married women again, who erroneously desire to utilize their spare time in working for shops, neglect domestic duties, and thus lower the price of female labour of single women.

Occasionally their female hands continue their occupation for a time after marriage, but if they become pregnant they leave the Factory six or eight weeks before the expected confinement.

If the position of Whitechapel were determined by the figures of the last few years the district would stand higher on the list.

It would appear that about 25 per cent. of the births are attended by registered midwives, but as the available statistics cover a short period only, the conclusions can hardly be taken as final. The majority of the infants are breast fed, at all events for the first few weeks. Only a comparatively small number of mothers in this district go to work regularly and leave their children in charge of others. As there are few factories and laundries in the neighbourhood as compared with other districts further west, married women have limited opportunity of getting work other than as domestic servants or charwomen, so there would appear to be little inducement for them to do so. In some cases, however, mothers, who would otherwise have been able to nurse their infants, were obliged to partially wean them in order to go to work.

Any artifical feeding being only a regrettable alternative to breast-feeding it is necessary to give a reason for 204 children admitted to the Depot in 1907 not being able to have their own natural food.

In only three cases of married women did the mother's occupation prevent her suckling, but 6 children were illegitimate and no doubt in most of these the mother was obliged to go to work to support herself.

"being due to this cause. 33 Preventive Methods. To cure a disease you must first find the cause. I have tried to indicate in the previous chapter the principal conditions which are associated with a high infant death-rate. The first of these is concerned with the physical well-being of the mother, and is, consequently, a social and economic problem of the first magnitude, towards which there are indications that the State is turning its attention. There can be little doubt but that a considerable proportion of the deaths of infants are due to industrial necessities, and that the employment of married women in factories is responsible for many of the deaths from prematurity and allied conditions. The recent conference on infantile mortality devoted a good deal of attention to this aspect of the question, and passed a resolution-demanding an amendment of the present Factory and Workshops Act, to extend the period during which a factory or workshop shall not ""knowingly"" employ a woman within four weeks after childbirth, to three months. It is clear, therefore, that measures which have for their object the physical welfare of the mothers must of necessity tend to raise the standard of motherhood, and thereby",Battersea,"married,women",bigram search,b18048390,Battersea.1907.b18048390.txt,1907,"employment,employed,employee,work,working,worked,job,occupation",bigram + list of terms
"the question of premature weaning, but under present social conditions it is doubtful if it is so important a factor in infantile mortality as it is somtimes represented to be. The Registrar General in his Report for 1905, discusses the question of Infantile Mortality and the employment of married women. He took two groups of fifteen towns, each containing respectively the lowest and the highest proportions of occupied married women, and compared their birth rate and infantile mortality in two quinquennia. The birth rate is, as might have been anticipated, lower in the towns having a high proportion of the married women industrially employed. The relationship between industrial employment of married women and infant mortality is however, not very visible. In the first group of towns, having only 4 to 8 per cent. of its married women engaged in occupations, the infant mortality in 1901-5 varied from 104 in Burton-on-Trent to 202 in Aberdare, the average for the 15 towns being 161; in the second group of towns having from 20 to 39 per cent. of its married women engaged in occupations, the infant mortality varied from 140 in Rochdale to 206 in Longton, the average for the 15 towns",Acton,"married,women",bigram search,b19783437,Acton.1908.b19783437.txt,1908,"employment,employed,employee,work,working,worked,job,occupation",bigram + list of terms

Others again work so as to keep in touch with the industrial world, and to keep their deftness of touch and general skill unimpaired. In the uncertainty of men's employment precaution of this kind on the part of married women out-workers is not without justification.

Formerly, married female labour was almost universally held to be an etiological factor of preponderating importance, and the general tendency of legislation has been towards placing checks on the industrial employment of married women. It is very difficult to eradicate a fallacy which has originated in high quarters, and when a high authority asserted that the absence of the mother from the home, constitutes one of the greatest dangers to infant life, those unacquainted with the social, economic and sanitary circumstances of the industrial classes accepted the dictum in its entirety.

The causes of the fall in the English birth-rate have been discussed in the recent Annual Reports of the Registrar-General, and the conclusion reached is that the fall is due to a decrease (1) in illegitimacy ; (2) in the marriage-rate; and (3) in the fertility of marriages, which again is due to (a) the greater proportion of older women in the population of married women at conceptive ages, and (b) the voluntary limitation of the family.

In order that the Inquiry throughout the country should be of a uniform character, it was decided that investigations should only extend to births registered in 1908; but since it was desirable to complete the records of the first year of life, the enquiry could not be concluded before the end of 1909.

This is especially the case in Acton where 3,500 women are employed in the laundry industry alone, and of these about 1,500 are married women or widows. About one-third of the married women in the South-West Ward are employed in laundry work, often the mothers do not come home in the middle of the day, or they have no time or energy to prepare a proper meal for themselves or their children. Under these circumstances a creche is almost a necessity, for in the South-West Ward alone there are about 200 babies under 12 months of age placed out with neighbours during the day, and the conditions under which they are cared for is extremely unsatisfactory.

University College of the University of London issued in 1906 the first of the studies in national deterioration from its department of applied mathematics, in which Heron showed results of superlative interest as to the relation of human fertility to social status during the years 1851 to 1901. They may be summed up as follows : 1. In 1901, in homes where many domestic servants are kept, there the married women have fewest children. This relation is exceedingly close. 2. Prevalence of cancer, especially amongst females, is associated with a low birth-rate. 3. Where labour is of the lowest type, where poverty leads to the pawnbroker and forces the child at an early age into employment, there the married women have most offspring. 30 4. The greater the overcrowding, and the prevalence of phthisis and pauper lunacy, the higher is the birth-rate. 5.

The smallest incidence of disease, especially of diarrhœal diseases, occurs usually in districts supplied with water-closets. 5. In the history of several towns the conversion of a conservancy into a water-carriage system has been associated with a great reduction of mortality from diarrhœal diseases; whilst in other towns the continuance of conservancy systems has been associated with continued high diarrhœal mortality. 6.

"Table are the results of observations taken at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. 10. Industrial employment of many of our women in the borough is probably one of the important influences at work, for it is obvious that girls and young women who are employed in industrial work for many hours daily have but little time to make themselves practically familiar with the very numerous, and often apparently unimportant matters, which make all the difference between a well-ordered home and one which lacks the influence of a capable mother. Nevertheless, to what extent and in what manner the industrial employment of married women affects the infantile mortality is still a matter of discussion. Under present social conditions, the harmful effects are partly counteracted by the greater comfort and increased nourishment which such employment enables the mother to secure. The mortality from prematurity and congenital defects is higher in the East Ward of Deptford than in the remainder of the Borough and greater than the average of some other large towns.

"means that over 800 mothers die each year in England and Wales, as the result of child-bearing, whose lives would be saved if the experience of the rest of England and Wales were as favourable as that of London. But the recorded experience of London in respect of 20 puerperal fever is as unfavourable as that of the provinces. If this disease were to be eliminated, as it has been substantially from the experience of many lying-in-hospitals, a further saving of 1,100 lives of mothers would be secured annually in England and Wales. The close relationship between factory work for married women and excessive mortality from child-bearing is indicated. Although dogmatism as to causation is not justified, and the need for further intensive inquiry is suggested by the facts under each heading, Dr. Newsholme says the presumption is justified that better arrangements for ante-natal care and for midwifery attendance would go far to reduce the mortality from child-bearing. In order that official action may be taken for reducing maternal mortaliy and suffering in child-bearing, measures must be adopted for ascertaining what cases need help.

As instructed by the General Purposes Committee I beg to report on the above subject. The Matron of the Women Workers at the Perivale Fuse Filling Factory brought under my notice the difficulty of obtaining and retaining the services of married women at this factory on account of their inability to make arrangements for the care of their children. She informed me that there were approximately 1,800 women workers in the factory now, and that when the buildings were completed and the factory full, there would be not less than 4,000 to 5,000 women workers. Enquiries made by her amongst the women now employed at the factory showed that at the present time there were 26 who would leave 30 children to be looked after by day, and a similar number by night, and the Matron was of opinion that",Willesden,"married,women",bigram search,b19796699,Willesden.1916.b19796699.txt,1916,"employment,employed,employee,work,working,worked,job,occupation",bigram + list of terms
"some other child is reared in a yet more healthy manner. I would like the Committee to get clearly in. their minds that a child is a living unit from the time that conception occurs in the mother's womb. It will therefore be readily understood and conceded that everything that helps the mother helps the child. The first problem then is how can the mother be helped. There are many methods. There should be no industrial employment of women before and for some time after childbirth. Indeed it would be to the national advantage if there were no employment of married women who are rearing families. The mother during the period of bearing and nursing the child must be well fed. Willesden has recognised this fact and has provided hot and wholesome mid-day meals for expectant and nursing mothers. 907 such meals were provided during the eight weeks since the Committee last met. Medical advice should be available for the mother during pregnancy and a Municipal Antenatal Clinic has been established at 9, Willesden Lane, for expectant mothers. This has proved a boon and is being increasingly made use of.

I have in an earlier part of the Report given an account of the work done by the Child Welfare Department, and I think that the figures with regard to infantile mortality afford unmistakeable evidence of the value of that work. The sanitary conditions of the district are all favourable, there are no slums, no back to back houses, plenty of open spaces and fresh air, there are no industries employing married women to any large extent, and work has been fairly plentiful so that with the exception of that due to the strike of moulders there has been very little unemployment. 52 Table I.—Vital Statistics of Whole District during 1919 and previous years.

This industry has been established in the district for nearly half a century, and absorbs a large number of workers. In August 1915, there were 1048 single and 1640 married women employed in the laundry industry. It is probable that this number was exceeded ten years ago, and it is likely that at the present time fewer persons are employed than in 1915. The introduction of labour saving machinery has had the effect of closing most of the hand laundries, and this fact alone would account for a diminished number of employees.

"men to work on munitions during the war. The smaller proportion of females in the age groups 20-39 may be due to young women leaving Woolwich to find employment elsewhere, or to the fact that the London female population at these ages is increased by provincial immigrants who would not be likely to settle in Woolwich where there is very little opportunity for them to find work. This explanation is supported by the fact that, comparatively speaking, there is less female labour employed in Woolwich than in any other Metropolitan Borough, and particularly is this so in the case of married women of whom, approximately, one in twenty is employed compared with one in nine in London as a whole. 14 SECTION II.—VITAL STATISTICS.

"the distribution reveals some puzzling figures and does not lead to a definite conclusion. In the poor working class Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch, the rate of mortality in 1919-22 (2.55) was the lowest but two of all the Metropolitan Boroughs, surpassed only by the City of 17 London-a very special district-1.66 and the working class Borough of Stepney (2.42). Both Hampstead and Lewisham with the lowest rates of infant mortality of the metropolis had higher maternal mortality rates than Shoreditch (with the highest rate of infant mortality). Maternal mortality does not seem to bear much relation to the percentage of married women engaged in extra-domestic duties. In the Metropolitan Boroughs, the lowest mortalities are in those districts which have the highest percentage of married women engaged in some extra-domestic occupation. In last year's report, figures were given showing the position of Acton in this respect. The relationship between these two factors has been discussed, but no definite conclusion can be drawn.

Formerly, extra domestic labour carried on into late pregnancy was supposed to have considerable influence in bringing: about a premature birth. It is quite conceivable that employment of married women in laundries, which involved prolonged periods on their feet and in an upright position would be conducive to premature birth, but such conditions are now rare and in very few instances were the mothers employed in laundries or in any other industrial employment. An examination of the distribution of deaths from prematurity and other pre-natal causes would suggest that extra domestic labour is not now an important factor.

One of the Metropolitan Borough Councils approached the Corporation with the request for support for a resolution on birth control, couched in the following terms:— "" That this Council recognises that the question of family limitation is one to be settled by the individuals concerned. It further recognises, however, that a demand exists among the working class married women for reliable and private information as to methods of family limitation, and places on record its opinion that such married women should not be prevented, by lack of means, from obtaining the help they desire. It, therefore, calls upon the Ministry of Health to allow those Municipalities who wish to do so to provide facilities for such information through the public services."" The Corporation were unable to give the support desired, as it was felt that no genuine demand existed which could not be satisfied by medical agencies already in existence dealing directly with the individuals, or that",CityofLondon,"married,women",bigram search,b18253477,CityofLondon.1930.b18253477.txt,1930,"employment,employed,employee,work,working,worked,job,occupation",bigram + list of terms
"money in trying to cure them between the ages of 5 and 15. The main aspects of the problem were, therefore, the discovery of defects which existed and the securing of treatment when necessary. In the circular it was suggested that more Nursery Schools might be provided by Education Authorities and more Day Nurseries by Maternity and Child Welfare Authorities. Woolwich had had experience of day nurseries. They were established during the war and extensively used, but immediately after the war they were closed because nobody wanted to use them—no doubt due to the fact that there are relatively fewer married women employed in Woolwich than in any other Borough in London. With this avenue closed, it was necessary to find some other means of approaching the problem, and ultimately it was decided to institute a scheme to provide for the medical inspection of the toddler on similar lines to the medical examination of school children, but making provision for such examination in the third, fourth and fifth year of life. By such a scheme it is hoped to discover defects at least a year or two earlier than they would be discovered by the School Medical Service.

Experience in the now extensive Maternity and Child Welfare Services in the Borough has taught that there are a large number of ailments, some slight but debilitating, some serious and likely permanently to cripple health or to shorten life, from which women suffer, for the diagnosis and treatment of which existing facilities are inadequate. Experience of the conditions in this Borough has further convinced the Council that the demand existing among working class married women for information as to methods of family limitation is one which should be met by the provision of facilities through the Public Health Services. The latter, no less than the former, is essentially a medical question, and reference to the approved scheme for this Hospital will show that it is intended to place first rate medical advice upon all these matters at the service of the women of the Borough.

In this Borough there is no evidence of any widespread lack of nutrition; amongst the many that come under the direct aegis of my Department I have reason to think that the persons who fall farthest below the normal as regards nutrition are the married women (usually with several children)—this does not so much apply to those receiving Public Assistance allowances as to the wives of men at work but receiving low wages, a large percentage of which is frequently taken up in rent and fares.

This need for marieed female labour operates in diverse ways: it has its attendant evils as well as its economic advantages to the families concerned. the Day Nursery was established to meet the demands of the married women who worked in the laundries, and from its continued popularity, it shows that the demand still exists. Though Nursery 9 classes have been established, in some of the schools in the neighbourhood, the Day Nursery still works to capacity, and there is always a waiting list. Although the Day Nursery was established by a voluntary body, it was looked upon with sympathy, and supported by the Council's Health Committee, because it was believed that the conditions under which the babies were being minded, contributed to the high infantile mortality of the South-West Ward in those days.

The methods which were adopted to meet the shortage of staff arising from wartime conditions, e.g., employment of women as substitutes for porters and laundrymen, employment of married women and of staff generally beyond the normal 16 age of retirement, to which reference is made in my Interim Report for 1941, have continued to be applied throughout the year. There have been a number of vacancies which could not be filled at once—amounting on an average to about five per cent. of the total positions.

It was somewhat unfortunate that the nurseries were opened at a time when measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough and chicken pox were epidemic. In spite of the fact that the prime function of these nurseries is to release married women for industry, there are certain fundamental public health precautionary measures (e.g., exclusion of children with infectious or suspiciously infectious illness ; quarantine, etc.) which must be enforced in the public interest even although their enforcement may keep the mothers at home for a time. Infectious disease and its prevention in a day nursery is a serious problem requiring constant vigilant attention if the nursery is to be kept from degenerating into a hotbed of infection.

The demand for labour has been greatly in excess of the supply but the importation of labour from other regions has not been possible, except in small numbers, owing to the difficulty in securing lodging accommodation in this and adjacent areas. A marked feature of industry during the war years has been the services rendered by married women, who were called upon to assist in the national effort. During the latter part of 1945, there was a visible tendency for married women to leave industry, due no doubt to increasing domestic responsibilities consequent upon the return of evacuee children and men returning home from the Forces. During the year, work was commenced at a site in Thames Road on the erection of a new Government Training Centre for training building trade workers.

Shortage of staff was less than in previous years, but the educational care in the nurseries is still unsatisfactory owing to the shortage of trained nursery teachers and wardens. So far no explanation has been found for the relatively high rate of sickness absence in the day nursery staff.

Towards the end of the period, however, the position worsened slightly owing to the seasonal slackness for painters and also due to the easing of demands for other building trade workers locally. 11 On the women's side the position was also fairly steady with the exception of a rise towards the end of the year due to a general shortage of vacancies for factory work locally and to the requirements of married women who were seeking employment of a part-time nature to meet their domestic commitments.

Uncleanliness and untidiness was noted in a few of the cases, but in no instance was it found necessary to serve a statutory notice. If the uncleanliness was of a moderately severe degree a revisit was paid at an early date. The impression obtained by the inspector was that, on the whole, only people with fairly good accommodation were doing outwork, probably because there was so much other work for married women if they want to earn money. Nearly all outworkers are seasonally employed. Dog Nuisances The Council operates a byelaw to prevent the fouling of the public footpath by dogs.

On the Women's side the register contained a number of married women seeking part-time work and others who wanted certain kinds of employment for which there was little demand. It was possible to place a few part-time workers, with local laundries on evening work and also with a large bakery. With the improved weather in April the position changed appreciably and men returned to building and decorating whilst women were employed in local factories and a wide range of other industries.

Unemployment among women has remained steady throughout the year around a figure of 80, excepting during October when it jumped to 115. A similar movement occurred in October, 1951, and is attributed to the termination of employment in the Catering industry in holiday resorts. Of the women registered as unemployed in December, fourteen of them were Registered Disabled Persons. The increase in the Register for 1952, as compared with 1951, is mainly attributed to the return of married women to the employment field.

Following this increase in January, 1953, there has been a marked decrease in the daily attendances at the Nurseries. It should, however, be mentioned that for some months previously the number of applications for day nursery accommodation had somewhat diminished, largely due to the decline in the birth rate over the past four or five years and possibly in part due to the fact that there have been less opportunities for married women to find employment than there were two or three years ago.

"(b) On Retirement—That men and women who can give effective service should be given the opportunity, without regard to age, to continue at work if they wish. Unemployment among women is mainly comprised of clerical and shop workers for whom there is difficulty in placing on account of age restrictions, and of women who require work for a limited number of hours owing to domestic responsibilities, many of whom only register for short periods when the urge or necessity to take a job arises. The rise in the number of women registered as unemployed in October was mainly due to married women registering for employment following the return of children to school and not to any other cause. Of the 44 registered as unemployed on 6th December. 22 were over 40 and 22 under that age. Also 20 of the women registered were married.

Daily Guardian Scheme The supervised daily minding of children under school age, whose mothers are in full-time employment was established in this Area in 1947. It commenced very modestly with three married women who were prepared to take into their own homes, children whose mothers could not make any other satisfactory arrangements for minding by the day. Each guardian is paid one shilling a day for each child placed with her, irrespective of payment received from the mother. There are no retaining fees and payment commences after registration and evidence of the receipt of the child. No guardian may accept more than two 72 children.

"much evidence to show they are also happier and healthier if allowed to do so. Page 36 One of the objections raised to the employment of people beyond the present retiring ages is the alleged increased incidence of sickness amongst older members of the staff. In this connection a recent report on sickness in a health department of a local authority (published in the ""Monthly Bulletin of the Ministry of Health and the Public Health Laboratory Service"" for October, 1954), is of the greatest interest. It was found that in general women lost more time through illness than men and married women lost more time than a single woman. For each category, however, the sickness rates rose to a maximum for staff between the ages of 50 and 55, and decreased markedly thereafter. Both single and married women over 60 lost less working days per year than those in any other age group and men over 60 lost almost as little time as the youngest.

This occurred not so much through personal illness as through illness in other members of the family or other purely domestic reasons, e.g. being at home to let the sweep in. Naturally, married women were susceptible to such considerations to a greater degree than the unmarried.

The training included lectures on theology of sex and marriage, Personal relationships, physiology and preparation for marriage. 8 The Health Education Officer has given additional assistance during three sessions on specific points of presentation, with reference to experience in local schools.

One member also works for the Marriage Guidance Council in Croydon.

Briefly, contraceptive instruction and advice could be offered to married women for whom pregnancy was detrimental to health. The restriction of the service to married women and the limitation on medical grounds making pregnancy detrimental to health have become the subject of growing concern particularly in recentyears, and the Minister of Health has the matter under review in the light of current sociological trends. Within the framework of these limitations, the London County Council ran family planning clinics direct, and these were taken over by the London Borough Councils.

The result of this is that in many cases rehabilitation can only produce partial independence, supervision and care being required in these cases. With the greater age of patients the relatives in turn are often in the geriatric age group0 The greater employment of married women has not helped either, in that many of the younger members of the family, friends and neighbours are now not available to help. The solution of the problem must lie in the provision of a much more comprehensive domiciliary scheme. More flatlets with adequate warden supervision, more welfare home places suitably staffed to cater for these older and less independent people.

The first cervical screening clinic was opened at Hallfield Maternal and Child Welfare Centre on the 5th September, 1966, and a second at Harrow Road Maternal and Child Welfare Centre on the 4th November; each clinic is held weekly, up to twenty smears being taken at each session. Carcinoma of the cervix is most common in the 35-55 years age group, particularly in married women who have had several children. It is, however, desirable to screen all women at least every five years between the ages of 25 and 65; younger women should not be discouraged from having this examination, so that no lower age limit need be set.

"important developments in the mental health service in 1968 was the project of linking social workers to general medical practices. Following on the symposium held in 1967, at which a general practitioner suggested that it would be helpful to link social workers with general practitioners, arrangements were made for a psychiatric social worker to spend one afternoon session a week in the surgery of a general practitioner in the Wandsworth Central area. The social worker has been carrying out this work for 12 months, and in the year has had 68 surgery interviews. Most of the patients referred were young married women at home, perhaps because the session was held in the afternoon. Many of the patients were presenting physical symptoms and would not 83 normally have seen a social worker, but it was felt by the family doctor that there were unexplored emotional factors for which the patient needed help. Some patients showed problems in the management of their young children, others were at a crisis point in their life, e.g. separation from husband. The social worker endeavoured to identify certain specific areas of difficulty either in the patient herself or relating to her family, where it might be",Wandsworth,"married,women",bigram search,b18251262,Wandsworth.1968.b18251262.txt,1968,"employment,employed,employee,work,working,worked,job,occupation",bigram + list of terms
"plans to increase the staffing establishment of the Welfare Services by the introduction of three Welfare Assistant posts - one for each of the three geographical teams — became possible and it was anticipated that the vacancies would be filied early in 1970. It is significant that whilst there was only a limited response to our advertisements for an Assistant Principal Social Worker and the Social Welfare Officer vacancies, particularly from professionally qualified ancj/ or experienced people, our advertisement of the Welfare Assistant posts produced almost a hundred enquiries and over thirty applications. It has become apparent that among mature married women there are many who, though they may lack high academic or professional qualifications, nevertheless have the necessary qualities of personality and a desire to give service to the community which renders them a rich potential source of recruitment to the staff of Welfare Services at a Welfare Assistant level. Unfortunately, whilst plans to integrate the existing social work departments of King George Hospital and Chadwell Heath Hospital into the community based services were completea, it was not possible to advertise a joint appointment until the end of 1969 and the response was so limited that the post will",Redbridge,"married,women",bigram search,b19883304,Redbridge.1969.b19883304.txt,1969,"employment,employed,employee,work,working,worked,job,occupation",bigram + list of terms

A charge is made based on the cost of the service, but is reduced according to the recipient's means, where necessary. The establishment of the equivalent of 60 full time home helps has never been reached, and at 31st December 1970 there were 74 home helps, equivalent to 36 full time staff.

"from the beginning of the present century these changes, together with earlier marriage, shortening of time devoted to family building and nurture of small children and longer life expectancy, have had profound effects upon the social life of society. They have resulted, inter alia, in the lengthening of the later stages of married life when a couple are left alone but, conversely, the greatly extended educational facilities now made available has meant that the individual child remains financially dependent for a much longer period than hitherto. In combination, these factors have brought about an increase in the economic activity of married women throughout the country from 34.0% in 1961 to 41.1% in 1971. Locally, of all married women in Greenwich in 1901, 6.0% were economically active compared with the present figure of 47.7%. Social changes initiated by the increase in family income include a general rise in living standards and, with both parents becoming wage-earners, a re-distribution of family and household responsibilities.
