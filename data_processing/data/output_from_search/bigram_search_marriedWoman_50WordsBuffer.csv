The rate of mortality of females following industrial occupations cannot be estimated, nor yet, fairly, the average age at death, in consequence of the imperfection of the mortuary returns, which in the instance of married women do not in all cases specify the occupation followed. The particulars as to the cause of death, as given in Table XIV., are open to fewer crbjections on this score. Dressmakers and Milliners appear to die to a large extent from consumption, 42 per cent, of the deaths being attributable to this cause. There is no difficulty in associating this with the damage inflicted upon the health from excessive and late hours of work in close, crowded, and confined rooms, together with deficient bodily exercise.

Female labour is on a very unsatisfactory footing— young women living at home with their parents, certainly earn wages which contribute partly to their maintenance ; some married women work far below the fair value of labour to supplement the wages of a husband whose work is casual and uncertain, often from drunkenness ; female labour even attempts to compete with manufacturing establishments ; some married women again, who erroneously desire to utilize their spare time in working for shops, neglect domestic duties, and thus lower the price of female labour of single women.

Thus, the average number of births in the 10 years, 1841-50, was 1,398, whilst in 1883 it was the largest recorded, viz. : 6,502. The mean number of deaths in 1841-50 was 948, in 1883, 3,545 ; the ratio of births to deaths in 1841-50 was 148, and 183 in 1883. This difference in the ratios of births to deaths arises from the much greater number of married women in Hackney now, and the much smaller proportion of servants at present living in Hackney as compared with the number in 1841-50. The number of births to each 100 deaths was the same as for 1882, and is in excess of the mean for 1871-80, when it was 177.

The system of giving out work to be done by home-workers does not appear to be a desirable one, and is to a great extent responsible for certain evils in the industrial world. Homework is done mostly by women who are unskilled and unorganised, and thus without the means of insisting upon a proper wage.

"proportion of domestic indoor servants is high the birth-rate is low, and vice-versa. It is evident, however, that there is a source of error in these comparisons if the birth-rate be calculated on the total population. Domestic indoor servants are almost invariably unmarried, and they constitute a non-productive element of the population. Hence, any district having a large proportion of domestic indoor servants may be expected to have a comparatively low birth-rate, if the rate be calculated on the whole population. This source of fallacy can be avoided if we can state 15 the proportion of legitimate births per 1,000 married women living at the ages when they are physiologically capable of bearing children, that is between the ages of 15 and 45, and the proportion of illegitimate births per 1,000 unmarried women at the same ages.

It would appear that about 25 per cent. of the births are attended by registered midwives, but as the available statistics cover a short period only, the conclusions can hardly be taken as final. The majority of the infants are breast fed, at all events for the first few weeks. Only a comparatively small number of mothers in this district go to work regularly and leave their children in charge of others. As there are few factories and laundries in the neighbourhood as compared with other districts further west, married women have limited opportunity of getting work other than as domestic servants or charwomen, so there would appear to be little inducement for them to do so. In some cases, however, mothers, who would otherwise have been able to nurse their infants, were obliged to partially wean them in order to go to work. The percentage of those who did so was increased during the winter quarter, the period which corresponded to the time when the 45 greatest number of men were out of employment.

"a number of years would be fallacious. On the other hand, in Acton, since 1890, the birth-rate per 1.000 inhabitants has been fairly constant. It is, of course, understood, that we are now dealing with the proportion of children to the entire population and not with the birth-rate. Owing to various causes, the age-constitution of the population in Acton has changed, and the relative number of women between the ages of 15 and 45 has increased. This accounts for the apparent constancy of the birth-rate, but if the rate be expressed as the ratio of births to the number of married women between the ages of 15 and 45 years, the same phenomenon would be observed here as in the rest of the kingdom. In view of the fact that the relative proportion of children under 5 years has not altered, the usual method has been adopted, and the mortality from Measles has been expressed as the number of deaths per 100.000 of the population.

From inquiries made, it may be stated that one-third of the married women in the South-West Ward are employed in laundry work. In 1906, 724 births were registered in this ward, and in 1907, 671, so that in this ward alone there are over 200 children under one year of age who are, at any rate, +.o some extent, artifically fed, as a result of this one factor.

The relation of the industrial employment of married women to infantile mortality is a question that has been much discussed of late years. At one time it was thought that the employment of married women in factories and workshops was a very important cause of infantile mortality, but the evidence that has so far been adduced in support of this view is far from conclusive, and there is now a tendency to regard the industrial employment of married women as but a minor factor in the causation of infantile mortality.

It will be seen that 214 home-workers' premises have been inspected, and 114 that 27 men and 217 women were found to be engaged in home work. Of the 27 men, about half were tailors, and the remainder were shoe-makers, umbrella makers, etc. Of the 217 women, 75 were widows or single women; these latter workers, generally speaking, work at greater pressure, owing to the fact that they are often entirely dependent upon such work for their livelihood.

"being due to this cause. 33 Preventive Methods. To cure a disease you must first find the cause. I have tried to indicate in the previous chapter the principal conditions which are associated with a high infant death-rate. The first of these is concerned with the physical well-being of the mother, and is, consequently, a social and economic problem of the first magnitude, towards which there are indications that the State is turning its attention. There can be little doubt but that a considerable proportion of the deaths of infants are due to industrial necessities, and that the employment of married women in factories is responsible for many of the deaths from prematurity and allied conditions. The recent conference on infantile mortality devoted a good deal of attention to this aspect of the question, and passed a resolution-demanding an amendment of the present Factory and Workshops Act, to extend the period during which a factory or workshop shall not ""knowingly"" employ a woman within four weeks after childbirth, to three months.

The Registrar-General finds reason for stating that approximately 19 per cent, of the decline in the birth-rate of the last 37 years is due to the decrease in the proportion of married women of conceptive ages in the female population, and over 5 per cent, is due to the decrease in illegitimacy.

"the question of premature weaning, but under present social conditions it is doubtful if it is so important a factor in infantile mortality as it is somtimes represented to be. The Registrar General in his Report for 1905, discusses the question of Infantile Mortality and the employment of married women. He took two groups of fifteen towns, each containing respectively the lowest and the highest proportions of occupied married women, and compared their birth rate and infantile mortality in two quinquennia. The birth rate is, as might have been anticipated, lower in the towns having a high proportion of the married women industrially employed. The relationship between industrial employment of married women and infant mortality is however, not very visible. In the first group of towns, having only 4 to 8 per cent. of its married women engaged in occupations, the infant mortality in 1901-5 varied from 104 in Burton-on-Trent to 202 in Aberdare, the average for the 15 towns being 161; in the second group of towns having from 20 to 39 per cent. of its married women engaged in occupations, the infant mortality varied from 140 in Rochdale to 206 in Longton, the average for the 15 towns",Acton,"married,women",bigram search,b19783437,Acton.1908.b19783437.txt,1908

"were 7•9 and 6•9. Death being inevitable, there must always be a deathrate; but birth is not inevitable, and there is nothing in the nature of things to prevent the birth rate from falling to zero. The causes of the fall in the English birth-rate have been discussed in the recent Annual Reports of the Registrar-General, and the conclusion reached is that the fall is due to a decrease (1) in illegitimacy ; (2) in the marriage-rate; and (3) in the fertility of marriages, which again is due to (a) the greater proportion of older women in the population of married women at conceptive ages, and (b) the voluntary limitation of the family. The last, no doubt, is the chief cause that has been at work in the decline of the birth-rate. The following table shows the Ward and sex-distribution of the births, and the birth-rate for each Ward:— 17 Ward. Births. Birth rate per 1000 of the population. Males. Females. Total.

Among male occupations, apart from the general labourer, which comprises anything, the one on which the incidence was heaviest was that of carman, probably due to exposure, irregular food, with its usual accompaniment of regular drink. Among women, dressmakers seem to have been frequently attacked, but not a few of those notified are married women who are occupied solely in looking after their homes and in whose cases exist none of the generally ascribed causes of this disease.

There were 3,806 inspections of factories, workplaces and workshops, and as a consequence there were 187 written notices served; these for the most part related to the lack of cleanliness, unsuitable or defective sanitary accommodation.

"who regret the loss resulting from a cause which has been accepted as a desirable change. These two factors, though, are not the most important in the reduction of the birth-rate. We learn from the RegistrarGeneral's report that the operation of these combined causes accounts for only 21 per cent. of the decline in the birth-rate. There are sufficient grounds for stating that during the past 30 years approximately 14 per cent. of the decline in the birthrate (based on the proportion of births to the female population aged 15—45 years) is due to the decrease in the population of married women in the female population of conception ages, and that over seven per cent. is due to decrease of illegitimacy. With regard to the remaining 79 per cent. of the decrease, although some of the reduced fertility may be ascribed to 9 changes in the age constitution of married women, there can be little doubt that much of it is due to deliberate restrictions of child-bearing. The fact is also significant that at the last Census period, 1900—02, the fertility of English wives was lower than that recorded in any European country, except France.

Employment of Married Women in relatioti to Child-birth—It will be remembered that, as far back as 1907, several communications were received from the Home Office with regard to a proposed enquiry into the employment of married women both before and after child-birth, which was about to be organised throughout the various districts of England and Wales; and the Home Secretary expressed a hope that the Public Heatlh Department of this Borough would be able to co-operate. In order that the Inquiry throughout the country should be of a uniform character, it was decided that investigations should only extend to births registered in 1908; but since it was desirable to complete the records of the first year of life, the enquiry could not be concluded before the end of 1909.

This is especially the case in Acton where 3,500 women are employed in the laundry industry alone, and of these about 1,500 are married women or widows. About one-third of the married women in the South-West Ward are employed in laundry work, often the mothers do not come home in the middle of the day, or they have no time or energy to prepare a proper meal for themselves or their children. Under these circumstances a creche is almost a necessity, for in the South-West Ward alone there are about 200 babies under 12 months of age placed out with neighbours during the day, and the conditions under which they are cared for is extremely unsatisfactory.

"rural counties and lowest in London, despite the effect of overcrowding in houses and areas, the speaker continued:— ""Let us, then, briefly consider the quality of the decline (in the birth-rate). University College of the University of London issued in 1906 the first of the studies in national deterioration from its department of applied mathematics, in which Heron showed results of superlative interest as to the relation of human fertility to social status during the years 1851 to 1901. They may be summed up as follows : 1. In 1901, in homes where many domestic servants are kept, there the married women have fewest children. This relation is exceedingly close. 2. Prevalence of cancer, especially amongst females, is associated with a low birth-rate. 3. Where labour is of the lowest type, where poverty leads to the pawnbroker and forces the child at an early age into employment, there the married women have most offspring. 30 4. The greater the overcrowding, and the prevalence of phthisis and pauper lunacy, the higher is the birth-rate. 5.

In comparing the birth-rates of communities, it will be remembered that, when calculated on the total population, the birth-rate is, of course, largely influenced by the constitution of the population as regards age, sex and condition as to marriage, and a more accurate measure of the fertility of the population is obtained by calculating the birth-rate on the proportion of legitimate births to married women aged 15 to 45 years. In 1910 the legitimate birth-rate of Fulham per 1,000 married women aged 15 to 45 years was 182.8, and the corresponding rate of the County of London was 186.1. Illegitimacy.

"has been in progress, a comparison of the death-rate from Measles extending over a number of years would be fallacious. On the other hand, in Stepney, up to 1908, the birthrate remained fairly constant. The cause of this high birth-rate has been explained in this and previous reports. Owing to various causes, the age-constitution of the population of Stepney has changed, and the relative number of women between the ages of 15 and 45 has increased. This accounts for the apparent constancy of the birth-rate, but if the rate be expressed as the ratio of births to the number of married women of child-bearing age, the same phenomenon would be observed here as in the rest of the kingdom. The final results of the census have not been published, and it is impossible to give the number of persons living at each agegroup, but in view of the high birth-rate which has obtained in the Borough, the relative proportion of children under five years of age has probably not altered to any appreciable extent.

Although the number of cases investigated are not so large as could be desired, certain results have been obtained which cast some doubt upon the direct influence exerted by the industrial employment of women in producing excessive infantile mortality.

The districts in which last year's rates were below the averages were Kensington and St. Marylebone. Of the seven attacks reported last year, three occurred in primiparie, all unmarried women, two of them being unattended in their labour. Two of the children born to those women were dead at birth, and the third required instrumental assistance (there was some laceration). There was a history suggestive of gonorrhceal infection in one case at least. Of the four married women two had normal labours, a third was delivered with the help of instruments (some laceration), and the fourth was delivered of a dead child, she having chloroform and (presumably) surgical help in labour.

"to be derived from the facts just stated, is that it is a fallacy to calculate birth-rates on the gross population of the community, instead of on the number of women who, living at the child-bearing ages, are alone capablc of producing children. Nor must it be forgotten when considering the statistics relating to births that women are not now married so early in life as formerly, and that marriages before twenty-one are not nearly so numerous as they were twenty years ago; therefore, the fall in the birth-rate is undoubtedly partly due to the more limited time in which married women can bear their offspring. How much these later marriages of women have effected the birth-rate it is impossible to state with accuracy, for the particulars as to the age of persons marrying are no longer tabulated in the reports of the Registrar-General, which is to be regretted. The Medical Officer of Health in his annual report for 1904 discussed this question at length, when the conclusions he arrived at differed from those to which he has now given expression. The data were then altogether different, and, therefore, the inferences to be deduced from them were also different.

"Cauderlier (Les Lois de la Population, p. 188) carries with it conviction as to the large importance, in its effect upon the birth-rate of such migration. France is, it is affirmed, the country in which this ""migration interieure"" is most active. In departments such as Lozere, les Landes, la Haute Saone, l'Ariege, it is, allowing for the size of the populations concerned, more than double the amount of the emigration from Germany or England. M. Cauderlier (loc. cit. p. 188) argues that ""migration interieure"" operates as follows The birth-rate is higher in the towns because of the excessive proportions of married women of the reproductive ages (there were 158,000 married women per million inhabitants, from 15 to 50 years of age in the department of the Seine as against 139,000 in France as a whole). Fecundity, however, is lower in the towns (Seine 116, France 146, Basses Alpes 214, per 1,000 married women). The excessive proportion of married women in the towns, he says, is due to the fact that immigrants are in the main single persons eligible for marriage, or people recently married.

The fee a midwife receives for attending a confinement and for the subsequent 10 days' visiting varies in different localities from 5s. per case upwards, but usually a fee of 7s. 6d. to 10s. is expected. The charities employing midwives pay 5s. or 6s. a case, and provide the midwife with registers, forms, antiseptics, etc. It is apparent from the number of cases taken by midwives and the small fees paid that very few can rely solely on their practice as a means of livelihood. Many of them are married women who do not trouble to obtain a large practice; a few keep lying-in homes ; others, especially those with a fairly large practice, are approved by the Central Midwives Board to give practical instruction to pupils preparing for the Board's examination. The pupil resides with the midwife and goes with her to cases. The fees for pupils are usually about £1 1s. per week, which includes board and lodging in addition to the practical instruction given bv the midwife. Maternity charities.

"women of to-day cannot be fairly compared with the young women of the London of fifty years ago ; and they differ very widely in respect of the extent to which they may be expected to contribute to the London birth rate. An obvious difference in this respect arises owing to the fact that the large unmarried domestic servant class consists of women, who in very many instances, when they marry leave London ; there is, moreover, a distinct selective influence exercised, under modern conditions of London life, which materially affects the constitution, as regards social status, of the young married women transferred from the country to London. Influences such as these have quite unobtrusively transformed the London mothers of a later generation away from any close resemblance to those of an immediately preceding or of a yet earlier generation. The early Victorian married women of childbearing age cannot, therefore, legitimately be compared with the married women of like ages to-day, and failure to recognise this quite obvious fact is apt to cause much misunderstanding.

"Table are the results of observations taken at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. 10. Industrial employment of many of our women in the borough is probably one of the important influences at work, for it is obvious that girls and young women who are employed in industrial work for many hours daily have but little time to make themselves practically familiar with the very numerous, and often apparently unimportant matters, which make all the difference between a well-ordered home and one which lacks the influence of a capable mother. Nevertheless, to what extent and in what manner the industrial employment of married women affects the infantile mortality is still a matter of discussion. Under present social conditions, the harmful effects are partly counteracted by the greater comfort and increased nourishment which such employment enables the mother to secure. The mortality from prematurity and congenital defects is higher in the East Ward of Deptford than in the remainder of the Borough and greater than the average of some other large towns.

But the recorded experience of London in respect of 20 puerperal fever is as unfavourable as that of the provinces. If this disease were to be eliminated, as it has been substantially from the experience of many lying-in-hospitals, a further saving of 1,100 lives of mothers would be secured annually in England and Wales.

Although dogmatism as to causation is not justified, and the need for further intensive inquiry is suggested by the facts under each heading, Dr. Newsholme says the presumption is justified that better arrangements for ante-natal care and for midwifery attendance would go far to reduce the mortality from child-bearing.

It will therefore be readily understood and conceded that everything that helps the mother helps the child. The first problem then is how can the mother be helped. There are many methods. There should be no industrial employment of women before and for some time after childbirth. Indeed it would be to the national advantage if there were no employment of married women who are rearing families. The mother during the period of bearing and nursing the child must be well fed. Willesden has recognised this fact and has provided hot and wholesome mid-day meals for expectant and nursing mothers. 907 such meals were provided during the eight weeks since the Committee last met. Medical advice should be available for the mother during pregnancy and a Municipal Antenatal Clinic has been established at 9, Willesden Lane, for expectant mothers. This has proved a boon and is being increasingly made use of.

I have in an earlier part of the Report given an account of the work done by the Child Welfare Department, and I think that the figures with regard to infantile mortality afford unmistakeable evidence of the value of that work. The sanitary conditions of the district are all favourable, there are no slums, no back to back houses, plenty of open spaces and fresh air, there are no industries employing married women to any large extent, and work has been fairly plentiful so that with the exception of that due to the strike of moulders there has been very little unemployment. 52 Table I.—Vital Statistics of Whole District during 1919 and previous years.

Industrial employment of many of our women in the borough is probably one of the important influences at work, for it is obvious that girls and young women who are employed in industrial work for many hours daily have but little time to make themselves practically familiar with the very numerous, and often apparently unimportant matters, which make all the difference between a well-ordered home and one which lacks the influence of a capable mother. Nevertheless, to what extent and in what manner the industrial employment of married women affects the infantile mortality is still a matter of discussion. Until the present improved social conditions of the bread winner the harmful effects were partly counteracted by the greater comfort and increased nourishment which such employment enabled the mother to secure. The mortality from prematurity and congenital defects is higher in the East Ward of Deptford than in the remainder of the Borough and greater than the average of some other large towns.

In August 1915, there were 1048 single and 1640 married women employed in the laundry industry. It is probable that this number was exceeded ten years ago, and it is likely that at the present time fewer persons are employed than in 1915. The introduction of labour saving machinery has had the effect of closing most of the hand laundries, and this fact alone would account for a diminished number of employees.

Married Women's Labour.—Ever since I have had women officers on my staff, they have been instructed to advise all married women to let the care of the home, husband and children, take the first place in their life-work and therefore not to attempt work which necessitates their absence from the home for long periods of each day. Shocking examples of neglect of this advice too frequently come under my notice in connection with dirty homes and verminous and neglected children.

"men to work on munitions during the war. The smaller proportion of females in the age groups 20-39 may be due to young women leaving Woolwich to find employment elsewhere, or to the fact that the London female population at these ages is increased by provincial immigrants who would not be likely to settle in Woolwich where there is very little opportunity for them to find work. This explanation is supported by the fact that, comparatively speaking, there is less female labour employed in Woolwich than in any other Metropolitan Borough, and particularly is this so in the case of married women of whom, approximately, one in twenty is employed compared with one in nine in London as a whole. 14 SECTION II.—VITAL STATISTICS.

"the distribution reveals some puzzling figures and does not lead to a definite conclusion. In the poor working class Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch, the rate of mortality in 1919-22 (2.55) was the lowest but two of all the Metropolitan Boroughs, surpassed only by the City of 17 London-a very special district-1.66 and the working class Borough of Stepney (2.42). Both Hampstead and Lewisham with the lowest rates of infant mortality of the metropolis had higher maternal mortality rates than Shoreditch (with the highest rate of infant mortality). Maternal mortality does not seem to bear much relation to the percentage of married women engaged in extra-domestic duties. In the Metropolitan Boroughs, the lowest mortalities are in those districts which have the highest percentage of married women engaged in some extra-domestic occupation.

Children under 5 years of age are admitted to the Infants' Departments whenever, in the opinion of the School Attendance Committee, it is desirable because the children cannot be properly cared for at home on account of the mother having to go out to work or on account of some other circumstance militating against proper care at home during the ordinary school hours. Very few married women are engaged in regular employment in the district and consequently there is little demand for a special nursery school. SECONDARY SCHOOLS. Secondary Schools, one for boys and one for girls, have been provided by the Middlesex Education Committee in Ealing. The school for girls was opened during the year under review. Medical inspection is carried out by the Ealing School Medical Department, but the report on this inspection is submitted to the Middlesex Education Committee.

"1.21 in ten years 1911-1920. A further report on Cancer of the Breast, with special reference to its associated antecedent conditions, by Dr. Janet Lane-Claypon, has been issued by the Ministry of Health (Eeports on Public Health and Medical Subjects No. 32). Dr. Lane-Claypon obtained records relating to some 508 cases of breast cancer among women and of 509 women of similar social and civil condition not suffering or having suffered from cancer. A comparison of the two series of records confirms the observation that cancer of the breast is more frequent among the unmarried, and further shows that among married women the incidence is greater among those who have not suckled their children or are childless. Among antecedent conditions most frequently associated with breast cancer is injury of the breast. 29 In No. 99 of the Special Report series of the Medical Research Council, Dr. Matthew Young and Mr. W. T. Russell discuss the incidence of Cancer in relation to various trades and professions. Anthrax. During 1925, seven cases of anthrax occurred in London, of which two died.

There is some correlation between the incidence of maternal mortality and the percentage of illegitimate births, a closer correlation with the percentage of domestic servants and closer correlation still with the percentage of single women between 20 and 25 years of age. In 1927 the London mortality from puerperal fever among single women was 3.22 per 1,000 births, as compared with 115 per 1,000 births among married women. For other accidents of child-birth the figures were 2 93 and 146 respectively. It would add materially to the value of the statistics of maternal mortality if the deaths of married women were stated as a rate per 1,000 legitimate births, and of single women as a rate per 1,000 illegitimate births. In the medical press references have recently been made to the increase of abortion among married women. It is probable that one of the factors in the present unsatisfactory position with regard to maternal mortality, in spite of improvement in administration measures, is the increased burden of motherhood resulting from present economic conditions. 12 Typhoid There were 322 notifications of typhoid fever in London in 1927 (52 weeks), fever. as compared with 302 in 1926.

Formerly, extra domestic labour carried on into late pregnancy was supposed to have considerable influence in bringing: about a premature birth. It is quite conceivable that employment of married women in laundries, which involved prolonged periods on their feet and in an upright position would be conducive to premature birth, but such conditions are now rare and in very few instances were the mothers employed in laundries or in any other industrial employment. An examination of the distribution of deaths from prematurity and other pre-natal causes would suggest that extra domestic labour is not now an important factor.

It further recognises, however, that a demand exists among the working class married women for reliable and private information as to methods of family limitation, and places on record its opinion that such married women should not be prevented, by lack of means, from obtaining the help they desire. It, therefore, calls upon the Ministry of Health to allow those Municipalities who wish to do so to provide facilities for such information through the public services.""

In the circular it was suggested that more Nursery Schools might be provided by Education Authorities and more Day Nurseries by Maternity and Child Welfare Authorities. Woolwich had had experience of day nurseries. They were established during the war and extensively used, but immediately after the war they were closed because nobody wanted to use them—no doubt due to the fact that there are relatively fewer married women employed in Woolwich than in any other Borough in London. With this avenue closed, it was necessary to find some other means of approaching the problem, and ultimately it was decided to institute a scheme to provide for the medical inspection of the toddler on similar lines to the medical examination of school children, but making provision for such examination in the third, fourth and fifth year of life. By such a scheme it is hoped to discover defects at least a year or two earlier than they would be discovered by the School Medical Service.

Experience in the now extensive Maternity and Child Welfare Services in the Borough has taught that there are a large number of ailments, some slight but debilitating, some serious and likely permanently to cripple health or to shorten life, from which women suffer, for the diagnosis and treatment of which existing facilities are inadequate. Experience of the conditions in this Borough has further convinced the Council that the demand existing among working class married women for information as to methods of family limitation is one which should be met by the provision of facilities through the Public Health Services. The latter, no less than the former, is essentially a medical question, and reference to the approved scheme for this Hospital will show that it is intended to place first rate medical advice upon all these matters at the service of the women of the Borough.

There is no birthcontrol clinic inside the borough, but there are at least three in neighbouring boroughs and it is known that a large number of our married women make extensive use of these. In another paragraph, I refer to the deaths from sepsis following abortion, and it must be admitted that where contraceptive methods are not used, other practices are followed which are more harmful still to the mother. It is a subject which no one wished to discuss, but it would be idle to ignore certain facts, such as the activity of abortionists among mothers, the extensive use of aborticfacient drugs and mechanical attempts at abortion.

This Conference, however, is deeply impressed by the reports it has received of malnutrition among married women especially in areas where prolonged unemployment persists ; it is not satisfied that all Local Authorities are exercising or can exercise, their present powers so as to prevent continuous and increasing deterioration in health among such women; and it therefore urges the Ministry of Health and H.M.

"as to what constitutes malnutrition in a person. Lack of sufficient food is a potent and definite factor, but so too is lack of the right kind of food; further, inability to absorb food even of the correct kind is another factor bearing upon malnutrition, and the circumstances which might bring about this inability are numerous. In this Borough there is no evidence of any widespread lack of nutrition; amongst the many that come under the direct aegis of my Department I have reason to think that the persons who fall farthest below the normal as regards nutrition are the married women (usually with several children)—this does not so much apply to those receiving Public Assistance allowances as to the wives of men at work but receiving low wages, a large percentage of which is frequently taken up in rent and fares. It is hoped that the recently inaugurated scheme for the feeding of nursing and expectant mothers may help to some extent in this direction.

This need for marieed female labour operates in diverse ways: it has its attendant evils as well as its economic advantages to the families concerned. the Day Nursery was established to meet the demands of the married women who worked in the laundries, and from its continued popularity, it shows that the demand still exists.

The extra money is 2 temptation, but the home of the outdoor worker under the best of conditions presents a serious social problem. In some industrial encouragement is given to young married women to return to factories; they are the more experienced and expert workers, and requests are frequently made for their return, especially at rush periods.

The methods which were adopted to meet the shortage of staff arising from wartime conditions, e.g., employment of women as substitutes for porters and laundrymen, employment of married women and of staff generally beyond the normal 16 age of retirement, to which reference is made in my Interim Report for 1941, have continued to be applied throughout the year.

A marked feature of industry during the war years has been the services rendered by married women, who were called upon to assist in the national effort. During the latter part of 1945, there was a visible tendency for married women to leave industry, due no doubt to increasing domestic responsibilities consequent upon the return of evacuee children and men returning home from the Forces.

The administration of these nurseries falls to the welfare committee in that it is the committee which has to be responsible for the arrangements for ensuring the health and well-being of the children but this is more the concern of the staff, whereas what concerns the committee more is the justification for the nurseries which leads to the discussion of such problems as the employment of married women and the country's drive for export. Again the domestic help service is not so very far removed from a domestic service agency, and while the service 5 deals with conditions closely related to the health or the sickness of the community the trend is the growth of a social welfare rather than a health, and certainly rather than a preventive health, service.

Outworkers.—Premises where homework is carried on were visited on 30 occasions by the Woman Inspector. No case of Infectious Disease was reported during the year. It is significant 33 to note that the number of Outworkers has increased, which indicates that many married women with home ties prefer to work in their own time.

"with the utmost difficulty that a reasonable standard of efficiency was maintained. When the flying-bomb attack developed in 1944-45, the hospitals sustained further damage. Child-patients and chronic sick patients, together with nursing staff, were evacuated from London to hospitals administered by other authorities, and four hospitals were opened by the Council in the provinces with staff of all grades, mostly transferred from London. This increased the difficulties and it became necessary to resort to the recruitment of persons not normally eligible for employment, e.g., aliens and staff beyond the normal age of retirement; to extend the fields of employment of married women and part-time workers; and to employ women on work hitherto done by men. Return of staff from war service With the conclusion of the war, 322 members of the permanent staff returned by the end of 1945, and a further 706 by the end of 1946; 72 members of the staff were 58 killed in action or died on war service, apart from those killed in London by bombs.

In the boroughs of Kingston, Maiden and Coombe, and Surbiton, and the Esher Urban District, which is the area with which the local Employment Exchange deals, approximately 2,000 more men, and 300 less women, were employed than in 1946. The total figure of employed persons was some 6,000 more than in 1939. The percentage figure for unemployed was very small. Towards the end of the year, signs of a desire to return to work on the part of married women was noticed, and the numbers on the womens' register was higher than for some years. As a result of the raising of the school leaving age, there were only 222 leavers as compared with the usual 600, so that the supply of juvenile labour was not nearly sufficient to meet the demand.

Opinion expressed as to the advisability of employing married women varied.; Some firms preferred them on account of their greater sense of responsibility while others complained that the curtailed working day, irregular time keeping and absenteeism for domestic reasons created administrative and production problems. 44 Employment of Young Persons The employment of young persons is general, but the proportion varies according to the nature of the industry.; In only two instances has mention been made of an apprentice system. This may be a reflection of the unwillingness of young people to commit themselves to one class of employment over a period of years, and in the case of",Tottenham,"married,women",bigram search,b19881897,Tottenham.1952.b19881897.txt,1952
"and men did not remain long unemployed. Although unemployment is slightly higher than in 1951, the percentage of unemployment has kept below 2%. Unemployment among women has remained steady throughout the year around a figure of 80, excepting during October when it jumped to 115. A similar movement occurred in October, 1951, and is attributed to the termination of employment in the Catering industry in holiday resorts. Of the women registered as unemployed in December, fourteen of them were Registered Disabled Persons. The increase in the Register for 1952, as compared with 1951, is mainly attributed to the return of married women to the employment field. One interesting feature is the appreciable number of women at present working in districts outside Bromley who have registered at this office for local employment."" 20 METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.

"that many local authorities which have endeavoured to promote similar educational courses have met with a very poor response, it is satisfactory to record that the numbers completing our lecture course and being awarded certificates of attendance have exceeded our expectations. It is only to be expected, however, that there will be some falling off in the numbers enrolling for future courses, as the more enthusiastic members of the local food trades have already completed the course and considerable persuasion will be required to induce those less enthusiastic to attend. Many of the personnel engaged in the food trades are married women whose household duties will not permit their attendance at evening lectures. By arranging lectures on particular firms' own premises, thus allowing the staff to attend in the firm's time, we have overcome this difficulty in the case of some of the larger food establishments but this is not possible in the case of many of the smaller firms. This is one of the major factors which prevents many local traders from qualifying for a food hygiene certificate.

Following this increase in January, 1953, there has been a marked decrease in the daily attendances at the Nurseries. It should, however, be mentioned that for some months previously the number of applications for day nursery accommodation had somewhat diminished, largely due to the decline in the birth rate over the past four or five years and possibly in part due to the fact that there have been less opportunities for married women to find employment than there were two or three years ago. (c) The training of Students at the Nurseries for the Certificate of the National Nursery Examination Board continued.

"(b) On Retirement—That men and women who can give effective service should be given the opportunity, without regard to age, to continue at work if they wish. Unemployment among women is mainly comprised of clerical and shop workers for whom there is difficulty in placing on account of age restrictions, and of women who require work for a limited number of hours owing to domestic responsibilities, many of whom only register for short periods when the urge or necessity to take a job arises. The rise in the number of women registered as unemployed in October was mainly due to married women registering for employment following the return of children to school and not to any other cause. Of the 44 registered as unemployed on 6th December. 22 were over 40 and 22 under that age. Also 20 of the women registered were married.

"much evidence to show they are also happier and healthier if allowed to do so. Page 36 One of the objections raised to the employment of people beyond the present retiring ages is the alleged increased incidence of sickness amongst older members of the staff. In this connection a recent report on sickness in a health department of a local authority (published in the ""Monthly Bulletin of the Ministry of Health and the Public Health Laboratory Service"" for October, 1954), is of the greatest interest. It was found that in general women lost more time through illness than men and married women lost more time than a single woman. For each category, however, the sickness rates rose to a maximum for staff between the ages of 50 and 55, and decreased markedly thereafter. Both single and married women over 60 lost less working days per year than those in any other age group and men over 60 lost almost as little time as the youngest.

Assuming no radical change in the pattern of marriage the 13 per cent, difference between the adjusted birth rate for London and the national figure can be accounted for as to 5 per cent, by the proportionately fewer married women in London and as to 8 per cent, by a real difference in the fertility of London marriages.

As indicated earlier, unlike pneumonia, bronchitis is a disease from which a person may have suffered for many years before death. This is evident from the morbidity statistics produced by the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, based on claims for sickness benefit. Certificates in support of such claims now cover practically the entire employed male population, but they are not so representative of the female population because only married women who follow a paid employment are eligible for national insurance and, of those that are, two.thirds of them ' opt out' of the scheme for sickness benefit. The latest Digest of statistics analysing certificates of incapacity ', relating to 1956.57, show that, for both sexes, bronchitis was one of the two most common causes of sickness absence (for which a claim was made) and was the reason for the highest number of days of absence. The other most important cause of absence was influenza, which fluctuated from year to year whilst bronchitis is more consistent.

It is said to be commoner in breasts that have not fed children and the decrease in deaths may therefore be associated with the relative increase in the number of married women since the 30's. 10 Cancer of the Uterus: The Medical Officer of Health of Hendon, Dr. Patton, has analysed the deaths from cancer of the uterus in the Boroughs and Districts of Middlesex during the past five years (1957-1962).

"only deal with women where there is a medical reason against pregnancy gives rise to much difficulty. Much must be left to the conscience of the individual doctor. I believe that the narrow view that medical reasons must only include some definite physical reason is now out-dated. A combination of social circumstances, family circumstances, and possibly some minor ailment might constitute a perfectly valid reason for a woman to space her family by modern birth control methods. It is my own feeling that sooner or later local authority clinics should be given authority to give family planning advice to all married women who require it. As far as unmarried women are concerned, advice may not be given at local authority clinics, and at the date of this report, not at the accepted family planning clinics. It is my own personal view that this leaves one of the biggest problems of family planning unanswered.

It is, however, desirable to screen all women at least every five years between the ages of 25 and 65; younger women should not be discouraged from having this examination, so that no lower age limit need be set. Thus from the outset the screening service has been available to all women under the age of 65 living or working in Westminster, all appointments being made centrally through the Health Department at City Hall. To encourage the use of this service, an explanatory leaflet was specially designed for the general public for display",CityofWestminster,"married,women",bigram search,b18248287,CityofWestminster.1966.b18248287.txt,1966

It is not easy to recruit either midwives, health visitors or home nurses and the first two do not apparently attract married women wishing to return to work. Mothercraft sessions, held in doctors' surgeries and on Corporation premises, have drawn midwives and health visitors more closely together. Now that it is no longer necessary for a health visitor to be a state certified midwife it is essential that the midwife takes over that part of the teaching dealing with the management of labour and the establishment of breast feeding and matters relating to the puerperium, whilst the health visitor talks on the preparation of the nursery, the layette and various problems relating to the first years of life.

It is significant that whilst there was only a limited response to our advertisements for an Assistant Principal Social Worker and the Social Welfare Officer vacancies, particularly from professionally qualified ancj/ or experienced people, our advertisement of the Welfare Assistant posts produced almost a hundred enquiries and over thirty applications. It has become apparent that among mature married women there are many who, though they may lack high academic or professional qualifications, nevertheless have the necessary qualities of personality and a desire to give service to the community which renders them a rich potential source of recruitment to the staff of Welfare Services at a Welfare Assistant level. Unfortunately, whilst plans to integrate the existing social work departments of King George Hospital and Chadwell Heath Hospital into the community based services were completea, it was not possible to advertise a joint appointment until the end of 1969 and the response was so limited that the post will",Redbridge,"married,women",bigram search,b19883304,Redbridge.1969.b19883304.txt,1969

A charge is made based on the cost of the service, but is reduced according to the recipient's means, where necessary. The establishment of the equivalent of 60 full time home helps has never been reached, and at 31st December 1970 there were 74 home helps, equivalent to 36 full time staff. During the year 97 applicants were interviewed; 39 of these were not considered suitable or found other employment. There is a potential reservoir of married women who are interested in doing this type of work but cannot make arrangements for their school children to be cared for during the school holidays. These recruitment difficulties have resulted in heavy pressure on existing staff which has in some instances proved inadequate to meet the demands on the service.

The test is for apparently healthy women only and no examination, apart from the cervical smear, is carried out. It is recommended that the test be taken at five-yearly intervals.

"account of a very important factor which seriously affects the comparison of some aspects of the incidence of births as between one area and another; namely the marital status of the women of child-bearing age in each. This was recognised by the Registrar General as long ago as 1954, when he wrote: ""The A.C.F. simply allows for the varying proportion of women of child-bearing ages in the aggregate local population, but not for many other factors, e.g. the proportion of the women who are married. Adjustment for the latter is required if the object is to compare fertility levels of married women in different areas."" Particularly during the last ten years concern has been expressed regarding the number of illegitimate births occurring in London as a whole and especially in Westminster where the proportion of illegitimate to total births has appeared exceptionally high when compared with other areas in London and elsewhere. Many reasons have been adduced to explain this including the assumption that a large number of pregnant unmarried women come to the Metropolis to seek anonymity and because the facilities for care during pregnancy and for confinement are better than elsewhere.

"from the beginning of the present century these changes, together with earlier marriage, shortening of time devoted to family building and nurture of small children and longer life expectancy, have had profound effects upon the social life of society. They have resulted, inter alia, in the lengthening of the later stages of married life when a couple are left alone but, conversely, the greatly extended educational facilities now made available has meant that the individual child remains financially dependent for a much longer period than hitherto. In combination, these factors have brought about an increase in the economic activity of married women throughout the country from 34.0% in 1961 to 41.1% in 1971. Locally, of all married women in Greenwich in 1901, 6.0% were economically active compared with the present figure of 47.7%. Social changes initiated by the increase in family income include a general rise in living standards and, with both parents becoming wage-earners, a re-distribution of family and household responsibilities. Indeed, the traditional view of woman as the home-maker and keeper is rapidly being transformed.

Their function has been particularly helpful in supporting new and inexperienced members of staff. This is relevant to the present situation, whereby the School Nursing workforce is mainly composed of young married women whose length of service will probably be limited. The amount of travelling time spent by each School Nurse was cut down because the geographical areas they serviced were reorganised during 1972. In addition, the number of minor ailment clinics held in the Borough was reduced in September, following the trends in other authorities, thus allowing better use of the School Nurses' time.
