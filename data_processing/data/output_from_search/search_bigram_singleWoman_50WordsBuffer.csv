Husband and wife appeared together at the Court, the former having found means to pay the fine; and expressed contrition for their disobedience and gave consent to the children being sent to the hospital, where they did well. Subsequently two other persons, a mother and her recently born infant, were attacked in the same house and both died. Another case in an adjoining house was traced to the same source of infection. The following fatal case excited a good deal of stir at the time, and was the cause of a sharp local outbreak :— The deceased, a single woman about 34 years of age, and apparently ®f morose and eccentric habits, lived alone in a first floor front room in a state of extreme squalor. On Sunday, March 18th, 1877, a female friend called to see her but was not admitted into her room.

"Director of Industrial Training eventually agreed to make the necessary arrangements. On completion of the course of training, the co-operation of the Employment Exchange was sought, and a suitable situation found for the man. F (aged 41 years).—This man and his family were specially recommended for accommodation on one of the Estates of the London County Council. A house became available just after his discharge from sanatorium, but he was unable to pay the cost of removal. The Tuberculosis Care Committee applied to the Red Cross Emergency Fund, and the desired assistance was granted. G (aged 34 years).—This patient, a single woman living with her sister-in-law, was without the means to provide herself with clothing for sanatorium. Application was made to the Charity Organisation Society, who made a grant of clothing and money to meet the difficulty. H (aged 68 years).—A widow. No income of her own, but an adopted daughter and an aunt paid the rent of the room she occupied. Application was made to the Charity Organisation Society, and temporary assistance given. The Society afterwards obtained a pension of 10/- a week for the patient, which will continue until she becomes eligible for the Old Age Pension.

The Committee, therefore, arranged with a firm of surgical appliance makers for her to be provided with one made specially for her, from which she derived great comfort—the outstanding debt on the previous one being cleared by the Committee, much to the relief of the patient M.C., aged 50. Patient had been ill and unable to work for four years. During that time she had a period of Sanatorium treatment. She was a single woman living with two sisters. Her parents were dead. The patient had only her National Health Disablement benefit, and the eldest sister had no income at all. She was unable to work but assisted in keeping house. The other sister, who was the breadwinner, was badly in need of a holiday, but she would not consent to go away without her sisters.

Case B.— Two sisters of 68 and 71 years living in one room which was verminous referred to the Department by their Doctor as both suffered from extensive impetigo of the scalp, and were verminous. They agreed to be admitted to hospital for treatment and while there they were given notice to vacate their rooms and accommodation in a home for old people was found for them by the Area Welfare Officer. Case C.— A single woman of 76 years living alone. There had been complaints from other tenants of the house regarding the insanitary conditions in which 29 she lived, and her doctor referred her to the Department for removal as she was suffering from malnutrition; she refused to go to hospital. The patient was visited and it was found that the home conditions were not sufficiently bad to enforce removal under Sec. 47.

To do this, help is obtained from the home nursing and home help services, the meals-on-wheels service of the Womens' Voluntary Service and the Old People's Welfare Committee. Twenty-four persons were referred to the Department from various sources during the year and in only one case was it necessary to obtain a Court Order for removal to a Home. Details of this case are given below. Miss ""A"" was a single woman of 87 years of age who had been known to the Department for about two years. When first brought to our notice she lived alone in one top floor room which was very dirty and neglected and in need of thorough cleansing. The old person herself smelled offensively and had obviously not washed or changed her clothes for some considerable time.

"year. Most of the heart cases were associated with unsuitable accommodation, due to stairs. A typical case was a man of 70 with cardiac 8 weakness who had 24 steps from flat to street to negotiate. He was awarded 30 points towards a Ground Floor flat, although on other grounds of accommodation he had obtained only 5 points. In another instance, a man of 70, whose elderly wife was confined to bed with arthritis, was also awarded 30 points for a ground floor flat, though on other grounds he had obtained only one additional point. In a third case, a single woman with rheumatoid arthritis, who had to carry all water up two flights of stairs from bathroom to kitchen, was awarded 30 points for a ground floor flat, though only 7 points had been awarded on other grounds. There were two other similar cases, but in the remaining 12 recommended ground floor flat accommodations there were considerable additional points up to 85. From the medical causes, it is seen that the applications arise from the type of housing used by old people and children, immobilising the former on top floors and providing too frequent illness for the latter in",Beckenham,"single,woman",bigram search,b19785008,Beckenham.1956.b19785008.txt,1956
"infants, one a girl in her 'teens, two were between the ages of 25 and 45, five between 45 and 65. Pneumonia is still a disease to be reckoned with and more needs to be done towards its prevention. Bronchitis: Much the same can be said about this cause of death. Only 32 of the 67 deaths were persons over the age of 75. One infant was carried off, one school child, and one young man. Bronchitis is much commoner in men, partly because more men work in very dusty conditions and partly because more men smoke cigarettes. Not a single woman died from bronchitis in Edmonton under the age of 65 but nine men died. Between the ages of 65 and 75 there were three times as many deaths from bronchitis among men as among women. As I have said before women who do not wish to be widows should not buy their husbands cigarettes.

Adaptation of homes to install artificial kidney machines One application was received during 1969 for works of adaptation to the home of a patient accepted for chronic intermittent haemodialysis to be performed in her own home. The property in Notting Hill in which the works of adaptation were required were partly occupied by the patient - a single woman aged 25 years - together with three other young friends. Together they lived in a garden flat of which she was the lessee, occupied on a lease expiring in 1972. The landlords were themselves lessees of the property with limited power to make alterations to the premises and it was necessary for the patient to complete a licence in respect of the works and installation and including an Undertaking to reinstate the flat.

"causes of infant deaths, Table 2, page 67.) MATERNAL MORTALITY It is regrettable to have to record that there were two maternal deaths in Westminster during 1969; there were no such deaths in the City in 1968. Comparative statistical rates are set out in the General section of this report, page 67. Both these maternal deaths were associated with abortion. In one case, a married woman of 37 years, therapeutic termination of pregnancy (associated with sterilisation) was carried out in a teaching hospital. Unfortunately, an infection developed leading to death from suppurative bronchopneumonia. The second death related to a young single woman of 20 years who had undergone a criminal abortion which lead to the development of septicaemia. This patient was admitted to hospital but unfortunately died notwithstanding intensive treatment.
