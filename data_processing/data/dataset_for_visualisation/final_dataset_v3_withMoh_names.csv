Only a comparatively small number of mothers in this district go to work regularly and leave their children in charge of others. As there are few factories and laundries in the neighbourhood as compared with other districts further west, married women have limited opportunity of getting work other than as domestic servants or charwomen, so there would appear to be little inducement for them to do so.

The first of these is concerned with the physical well-being of the mother, and is, consequently, a social and economic problem of the first magnitude, towards which there are indications that the State is turning its attention. There can be little doubt but that a considerable proportion of the deaths of infants are due to industrial necessities, and that the employment of married women in factories is responsible for many of the deaths from prematurity and allied conditions. The recent conference on infantile mortality devoted a good deal of attention to this aspect of the question, and passed a resolution-demanding an amendment of the present Factory and Workshops Act, to extend the period during which a factory or workshop shall not ""knowingly"" employ a woman within four weeks after childbirth, to three months.

The Registrar General in his Report for 1905, discusses the question of Infantile Mortality and the employment of married women. He took two groups of fifteen towns, each containing respectively the lowest and the highest proportions of occupied married women, and compared their birth rate and infantile mortality in two quinquennia. The birth rate is, as might have been anticipated, lower in the towns having a high proportion of the married women industrially employed. The relationship between industrial employment of married women and infant mortality is however, not very visible. In the first group of towns, having only 4 to 8 per cent. of its married women engaged in occupations, the infant mortality in 1901-5 varied from 104 in Burton-on-Trent to 202 in Aberdare, the average for the 15 towns being 161; in the second group of towns having from 20 to 39 per cent. of its married women engaged in occupations, the infant mortality varied from 140 in Rochdale to 206 in Longton, the average for the 15 towns",Acton,Ealing,51.522475,-0.331026,b19783437,Acton.1908.b19783437.txt,http://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b19783437,bigram + list of terms,"married,women","employment,employed,employee,work,working,worked,job,occupation",None,1908,0,"Acton (London, England)"

Others again work so as to keep in touch with the industrial world, and to keep their deftness of touch and general skill unimpaired. In the uncertainty of men's employment precaution of this kind on the part of married women out-workers is not without justification. Possibly these workers, who are not entirely dependent on their earnings from outwork may tend to bring down wages and so to injure those who work for their livelihood, but occasionally their partial independence enables them to refuse unfair terms, probably with good effect.

Nevertheless, to what extent and in what manner the industrial employment of married women affects the infantile mortality is still a matter of discussion. Under present social conditions, the harmful effects are partly counteracted by the greater comfort and increased nourishment which such employment enables the mother to secure. The mortality from prematurity and congenital defects is higher in the East Ward of Deptford than in the remainder of the Borough and greater than the average of some other large towns.

If this disease were to be eliminated, as it has been substantially from the experience of many lying-in-hospitals, a further saving of 1,100 lives of mothers would be secured annually in England and Wales. The close relationship between factory work for married women and excessive mortality from child-bearing is indicated. Although dogmatism as to causation is not justified, and the need for further intensive inquiry is suggested by the facts under each heading, Dr. Newsholme says the presumption is justified that better arrangements for ante-natal care and for midwifery attendance would go far to reduce the mortality from child-bearing. In order that official action may be taken for reducing maternal mortaliy and suffering in child-bearing, measures must be adopted for ascertaining what cases need help.

The Matron of the Women Workers at the Perivale Fuse Filling Factory brought under my notice the difficulty of obtaining and retaining the services of married women at this factory on account of their inability to make arrangements for the care of their children. She informed me that there were approximately 1,800 women workers in the factory now, and that when the buildings were completed and the factory full, there would be not less than 4,000 to 5,000 women workers. Enquiries made by her amongst the women now employed at the factory showed that at the present time there were 26 who would leave 30 children to be looked after by day, and a similar number by night, and the Matron was of opinion that",Willesden,Brent,51.558556,-0.267821,b19796699,Willesden.1916.b19796699.txt,http://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b19796699,bigram + list of terms,"married,women","employment,employed,employee,work,working,worked,job,occupation",None,1916,Get the following 15 words or so for this entry,"Willesden (London, England)"

I would like the Committee to get clearly in. their minds that a child is a living unit from the time that conception occurs in the mother's womb. It will therefore be readily understood and conceded that everything that helps the mother helps the child. The first problem then is how can the mother be helped. There are many methods. There should be no industrial employment of women before and for some time after childbirth. Indeed it would be to the national advantage if there were no employment of married women who are rearing families. The mother during the period of bearing and nursing the child must be well fed. Willesden has recognised this fact and has provided hot and wholesome mid-day meals for expectant and nursing mothers. 907 such meals were provided during the eight weeks since the Committee last met. Medical advice should be available for the mother during pregnancy and a Municipal Antenatal Clinic has been established at 9, Willesden Lane, for expectant mothers. This has proved a boon and is being increasingly made use of.

It is probable that this number was exceeded ten years ago, and it is likely that at the present time fewer persons are employed than in 1915.

Formerly, extra domestic labour carried on into late pregnancy was supposed to have considerable influence in bringing: about a premature birth. It is quite conceivable that employment of married women in laundries, which involved prolonged periods on their feet and in an upright position would be conducive to premature birth, but such conditions are now rare and in very few instances were the mothers employed in laundries or in any other industrial employment. An examination of the distribution of deaths from prematurity and other pre-natal causes would suggest that extra domestic labour is not now an important factor.

The main aspects of the problem were, therefore, the discovery of defects which existed and the securing of treatment when necessary. In the circular it was suggested that more Nursery Schools might be provided by Education Authorities and more Day Nurseries by Maternity and Child Welfare Authorities. Woolwich had had experience of day nurseries. They were established during the war and extensively used, but immediately after the war they were closed because nobody wanted to use them—no doubt due to the fact that there are relatively fewer married women employed in Woolwich than in any other Borough in London. With this avenue closed, it was necessary to find some other means of approaching the problem, and ultimately it was decided to institute a scheme to provide for the medical inspection of the toddler on similar lines to the medical examination of school children, but making provision for such examination in the third, fourth and fifth year of life. By such a scheme it is hoped to discover defects at least a year or two earlier than they would be discovered by the School Medical Service.

NURSERY SCHOOLS. No nursery schools, as such are defined, have been established in the Borough. There is very little regular employment of married women and housing difficulties are not so acute as to call for special provision for children under 5 years of age. Some mothers certainly do go out to work and their children have to be looked after in their absence, but they are located at widely scattered parts in the Borough and are not so congregated as to make the opening of a nursery school convenient for all or even most of them.

The relatively very low proportion of children in the population is due to this low birth-rate, and to the fact that the larger families are particularly apt to move away from Central London. The City offiers much employment to single persons in resident posts as hotel, club or domestic servants, and to married couples without children as caretakers. 17.2 per cent, of the population recorded in the Census were resident in hotels, boarding houses and lodging houses, as compared with 3.6 over the",CityofWestminster,City of Westminster,51.513444,-0.160467,b18247945,CityofWestminster.1932.b18247945.txt,http://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b18247945,bigram + list of terms,"married,women","employment,employed,employee,work,working,worked,job,occupation",None,1932,0,"City of Westminster (London, England).

The Minister of Health in his Circular draws special attention to the fact that many authorities have a rule prohibiting the employment of married women and trusts that when first selecting midwives for salaried posts, the local authority will, where necessary, so revise this rule as to enable them to have regard only to their efficiency as midwives, subject, of course, to their ability to undertake whole-time employment.

Married female labour was largely utilised, but this has not been eliminated by present conditions. Although most of the work has become mechanised, some of the processes still require an extensive experience as well as individual skill, and some of the most experienced and skilful are married women. This need for marieed female labour operates in diverse ways: it has its attendant evils as well as its economic advantages to the families concerned. the Day Nursery was established to meet the demands of the married women who worked in the laundries, and from its continued popularity, it shows that the demand still exists. Though Nursery 9 classes have been established, in some of the schools in the neighbourhood, the Day Nursery still works to capacity, and there is always a waiting list. Although the Day Nursery was established by a voluntary body, it was looked upon with sympathy, and supported by the Council's Health Committee, because it was believed that the conditions under which the babies were being minded, contributed to the high infantile mortality of the South-West Ward in those days.

The extra money is 2 temptation, but the home of the outdoor worker under the best of conditions presents a serious social problem. In some industrial encouragement is given to young married women to return to factories; they are the more experienced and expert workers, and requests are frequently made for their return, especially at rush periods. This is especially true of the laundry industry, but far as our figures go, the same conditions do not apply in the factories in North Acton.

A marked feature of industry during the war years has been the services rendered by married women, who were called upon to assist in the national effort.

Factories where Women are Employed.—Since the termination of the war there has been some diminution in the employment of women. As a general rule employers continue to show an increased interest in the welfare of their women workers, although their efforts are hampered by the general shortage of necessary material. Outworkers.—Premises where homework is carried on were visited on 30 occasions by the Woman Inspector. No case of Infectious Disease was reported during the year.

In this connection a recent report on sickness in a health department of a local authority (published in the ""Monthly Bulletin of the Ministry of Health and the Public Health Laboratory Service"" for October, 1954), is of the greatest interest. It was found that in general women lost more time through illness than men and married women lost more time than a single woman. For each category, however, the sickness rates rose to a maximum for staff between the ages of 50 and 55, and decreased markedly thereafter. Both single and married women over 60 lost less working days per year than those in any other age group and men over 60 lost almost as little time as the youngest.

Samples of washing-up waters and swabs from kitchen utensils and equipment were taken from 68 premises, including restaurants, cafes, school kitchens and sculleries, factory canteens, hotel kitchens, public houses and shops.

Home Nursing Centre The service for patients residing north of the District Railway line was provided, as previously, by the staff from the Lady Rayleigh Training Home (under agency arrangements with the Essex County Council). South of the Railway line the service continued from the Liverpool Road Centre. Prom there the nurses go out to cover the whole of this area. Those patients who were able attended the Centre and were treated there. The service mostly depends on married women who can only spare a few hours a day from their home commitments, but who also have a real sense of vocation for nursing and enjoy their work. This has resulted in them voluntarily undertaking to maintain a latenight service where the need arises.

As indicated earlier, unlike pneumonia, bronchitis is a disease from which a person may have suffered for many years before death. This is evident from the morbidity statistics produced by the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, based on claims for sickness benefit. Certificates in support of such claims now cover practically the entire employed male population, but they are not so representative of the female population because only married women who follow a paid employment are eligible for national insurance and, of those that are, two.thirds of them ' opt out' of the scheme for sickness benefit. The latest Digest of statistics analysing certificates of incapacity ', relating to 1956.57, show that, for both sexes, bronchitis was one of the two most common causes of sickness absence (for which a claim was made) and was the reason for the highest number of days of absence. The other most important cause of absence was influenza, which fluctuated from year to year whilst bronchitis is more consistent.

The result of this is that in many cases rehabilitation can only produce partial independence, supervision and care being required in these cases. With the greater age of patients the relatives in turn are often in the geriatric age group0 The greater employment of married women has not helped either, in that many of the younger members of the family, friends and neighbours are now not available to help. The solution of the problem must lie in the provision of a much more comprehensive domiciliary scheme. More flatlets with adequate warden supervision, more welfare home places suitably staffed to cater for these older and less independent people.

It is not easy to recruit either midwives, health visitors or home nurses and the first two do not apparently attract married women wishing to return to work. Mothercraft sessions, held in doctors' surgeries and on Corporation premises, have drawn midwives and health visitors more closely together. Now that it is no longer necessary for a health visitor to be a state certified midwife it is essential that the midwife takes over that part of the teaching dealing with the management of labour and the establishment of breast feeding and matters relating to the puerperium, whilst the health visitor talks on the preparation of the nursery, the layette and various problems relating to the first years of life.

The Future of Health Visiting Generally, the dedicated spinster is now reaching the period of retirement; this particularly applies to the profession and and her loss will be very much felt in the community.

Nursery Nurses want more experience with older children and talk about employment in nurseries on board Ocean Liners, Air Hostess work and the Women's Police Force. It seems that recruitment to Day Nursery Service has reached a full cycle, losing the young nurse and being replaced by young married women with families.

They have resulted, inter alia, in the lengthening of the later stages of married life when a couple are left alone but, conversely, the greatly extended educational facilities now made available has meant that the individual child remains financially dependent for a much longer period than hitherto. In combination, these factors have brought about an increase in the economic activity of married women throughout the country from 34.0% in 1961 to 41.1% in 1971. Locally, of all married women in Greenwich in 1901, 6.0% were economically active compared with the present figure of 47.7%.
