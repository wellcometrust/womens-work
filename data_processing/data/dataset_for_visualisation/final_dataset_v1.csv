The Minister of Health in his Circular draws special attention to the fact that many authorities have a rule prohibiting the employment of married women and trusts that when first selecting midwives for salaried posts, the local authority will, where necessary, so revise this rule as to enable them to have regard only to their efficiency as midwives, subject, of course, to their ability to undertake whole-time employment.

Married female labour was largely utilised, but this has not been eliminated by present conditions. Although most of the work has become mechanised, some of the processes still require an extensive experience as well as individual skill, and some of the most experienced and skilful are married women. This need for marieed female labour operates in diverse ways: it has its attendant evils as well as its economic advantages to the families concerned. the Day Nursery was established to meet the demands of the married women who worked in the laundries, and from its continued popularity, it shows that the demand still exists. Though Nursery 9 classes have been established, in some of the schools in the neighbourhood, the Day Nursery still works to capacity, and there is always a waiting list. Although the Day Nursery was established by a voluntary body, it was looked upon with sympathy, and supported by the Council's Health Committee, because it was believed that the conditions under which the babies were being minded, contributed to the high infantile mortality of the South-West Ward in those days.

The extra money is 2 temptation, but the home of the outdoor worker under the best of conditions presents a serious social problem. In some industrial encouragement is given to young married women to return to factories; they are the more experienced and expert workers, and requests are frequently made for their return, especially at rush periods. This is especially true of the laundry industry, but far as our figures go, the same conditions do not apply in the factories in North Acton.

The demand for labour has been greatly in excess of the supply but the importation of labour from other regions has not been possible, except in small numbers, owing to the difficulty in securing lodging accommodation in this and adjacent areas. A marked feature of industry during the war years has been the services rendered by married women, who were called upon to assist in the national effort. During the latter part of 1945, there was a visible tendency for married women to leave industry, due no doubt to increasing domestic responsibilities consequent upon the return of evacuee children and men returning home from the Forces. During the year, work was commenced at a site in Thames Road on the erection of a new Government Training Centre for training building trade workers.

The categories entitling to preference in the allocation of nursery vacancies are as follow:— Separated or deserted wives. Widows. Unmarried mothers. Married women whose husbands are unemployed, or frequently ill and unable to work full time. Married women with husbands in the forces. Applications from married women whose husbands are in full-time employment are dealt with on their merits (the husband's earnings being one of the factors considered) when vacancies not required by the 21 priority groups are available.

Child-patients and chronic sick patients, together with nursing staff, were evacuated from London to hospitals administered by other authorities, and four hospitals were opened by the Council in the provinces with staff of all grades, mostly transferred from London. This increased the difficulties and it became necessary to resort to the recruitment of persons not normally eligible for employment, e.g., aliens and staff beyond the normal age of retirement; to extend the fields of employment of married women and part-time workers; and to employ women on work hitherto done by men.

In the boroughs of Kingston, Maiden and Coombe, and Surbiton, and the Esher Urban District, which is the area with which the local Employment Exchange deals, approximately 2,000 more men, and 300 less women, were employed than in 1946. The total figure of employed persons was some 6,000 more than in 1939. The percentage figure for unemployed was very small. Towards the end of the year, signs of a desire to return to work on the part of married women was noticed, and the numbers on the womens' register was higher than for some years. As a result of the raising of the school leaving age, there were only 222 leavers as compared with the usual 600, so that the supply of juvenile labour was not nearly sufficient to meet the demand.

Unemployment among women has remained steady throughout the year around a figure of 80, excepting during October when it jumped to 115. A similar movement occurred in October, 1951, and is attributed to the termination of employment in the Catering industry in holiday resorts. Of the women registered as unemployed in December, fourteen of them were Registered Disabled Persons. The increase in the Register for 1952, as compared with 1951, is mainly attributed to the return of married women to the employment field.

Following this increase in January, 1953, there has been a marked decrease in the daily attendances at the Nurseries. It should, however, be mentioned that for some months previously the number of applications for day nursery accommodation had somewhat diminished, largely due to the decline in the birth rate over the past four or five years and possibly in part due to the fact that there have been less opportunities for married women to find employment than there were two or three years ago.

Page 36 One of the objections raised to the employment of people beyond the present retiring ages is the alleged increased incidence of sickness amongst older members of the staff. In this connection a recent report on sickness in a health department of a local authority (published in the ""Monthly Bulletin of the Ministry of Health and the Public Health Laboratory Service"" for October, 1954), is of the greatest interest. It was found that in general women lost more time through illness than men and married women lost more time than a single woman. For each category, however, the sickness rates rose to a maximum for staff between the ages of 50 and 55, and decreased markedly thereafter. Both single and married women over 60 lost less working days per year than those in any other age group and men over 60 lost almost as little time as the youngest.

There has been no improvement in the recruitment of trained staff for full-time employment. The part-time staff are the mainstay of the service and we have been fortunate in retaining many of the present staff for over 5 years. Most of these are married women and some of them (who have older children) are now able to work additional hours. This has been a considerable help to the service and enabled all requests for nursing care to be met. Any extension to cover a later evening service, although desirable, cannot be contemplated until an appreciable increase in full-time staff is achieved.

As indicated earlier, unlike pneumonia, bronchitis is a disease from which a person may have suffered for many years before death. This is evident from the morbidity statistics produced by the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, based on claims for sickness benefit. Certificates in support of such claims now cover practically the entire employed male population, but they are not so representative of the female population because only married women who follow a paid employment are eligible for national insurance and, of those that are, two.thirds of them ' opt out' of the scheme for sickness benefit. The latest Digest of statistics analysing certificates of incapacity ', relating to 1956.57, show that, for both sexes, bronchitis was one of the two most common causes of sickness absence (for which a claim was made) and was the reason for the highest number of days of absence. The other most important cause of absence was influenza, which fluctuated from year to year whilst bronchitis is more consistent.

The department's work, to a certain extent, has been complicated by the fact that more married women now go out to work, and this means that frequently there is no one at home when a call is made. It is necessary, therefore, to make special appointments and revisits,, Time spent on the car and watching television has meant that back gardens tend more and more to become neglected and littered with rubbish and unwanted articles. Because of this, some difficulty is sometimes experienced in controlling rodent infestations. Infestations on new building sites are often due to the careless habits of workmen and it is necessary to maintain regular inspections of such premises.

The result of this is that in many cases rehabilitation can only produce partial independence, supervision and care being required in these cases. With the greater age of patients the relatives in turn are often in the geriatric age group0 The greater employment of married women has not helped either, in that many of the younger members of the family, friends and neighbours are now not available to help. The solution of the problem must lie in the provision of a much more comprehensive domiciliary scheme. More flatlets with adequate warden supervision, more welfare home places suitably staffed to cater for these older and less independent people.

It is not easy to recruit either midwives, health visitors or home nurses and the first two do not apparently attract married women wishing to return to work. Mothercraft sessions, held in doctors' surgeries and on Corporation premises, have drawn midwives and health visitors more closely together. Now that it is no longer necessary for a health visitor to be a state certified midwife it is essential that the midwife takes over that part of the teaching dealing with the management of labour and the establishment of breast feeding and matters relating to the puerperium, whilst the health visitor talks on the preparation of the nursery, the layette and various problems relating to the first years of life.

Each student worked with a reduced case load on the area they were later to take over. The Future of Health Visiting Generally, the dedicated spinster is now reaching the period of retirement; this particularly applies to the profession and and her loss will be very much felt in the community. The future depends on the service being covered by young married women who once having completed their contract, will leave to have their families. Once the family are grown up they will, we hope, come back into the Service. The turn over of staff 36 will therefore be rapid and with the general shortage of Health Visitors the future i uncertain.

In recent years, however, the trend has been at the end of training to try other jobs with more attractive hours of work - namely the Nursery Schools and Save the Children Fund. Nursery Nurses want more experience with older children and talk about employment in nurseries on board Ocean Liners, Air Hostess work and the Women's Police Force. It seems that recruitment to Day Nursery Service has reached a full cycle, losing the young nurse and being replaced by young married women with families. This maturity is valuable, and they are without doubt the nucleus of a good Nursery staff. The Nursery nurse marries at an earlier age and then uses her Certificate when her family has reached school age. - 31 - Many Play-Groups are now staffed with the young N.N.E.E.B. nurse who is keeping her contact with young children, and who one day will return to the Day Nursery.

It is significant that whilst there was only a limited response to our advertisements for an Assistant Principal Social Worker and the Social Welfare Officer vacancies, particularly from professionally qualified ancj/ or experienced people, our advertisement of the Welfare Assistant posts produced almost a hundred enquiries and over thirty applications. It has become apparent that among mature married women there are many who, though they may lack high academic or professional qualifications, nevertheless have the necessary qualities of personality and a desire to give service to the community which renders them a rich potential source of recruitment to the staff of Welfare Services at a Welfare Assistant level.

For sessional work a number of married women with children who wish to resume their professional life have been attracted to the service.

There is a potential reservoir of married women who are interested in doing this type of work but cannot make arrangements for their school children to be cared for during the school holidays.

They have resulted, inter alia, in the lengthening of the later stages of married life when a couple are left alone but, conversely, the greatly extended educational facilities now made available has meant that the individual child remains financially dependent for a much longer period than hitherto. In combination, these factors have brought about an increase in the economic activity of married women throughout the country from 34.0% in 1961 to 41.1% in 1971. Locally, of all married women in Greenwich in 1901, 6.0% were economically active compared with the present figure of 47.7%. Social changes initiated by the increase in family income include a general rise in living standards and, with both parents becoming wage-earners, a re-distribution of family and household responsibilities.

This is relevant to the present situation, whereby the School Nursing workforce is mainly composed of young married women whose length of service will probably be limited. The amount of travelling time spent by each School Nurse was cut down because the geographical areas they serviced were reorganised during 1972. In addition, the number of minor ailment clinics held in the Borough was reduced in September, following the trends in other authorities, thus allowing better use of the School Nurses' time.
