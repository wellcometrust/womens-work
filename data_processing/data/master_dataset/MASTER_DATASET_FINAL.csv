About one-third of the married women in the South-West Ward are employed in laundry work, often the mothers do not come home in the middle of the day, or they have no time or energy to prepare a proper meal for themselves or their children. Under these circumstances a creche is almost a necessity, for in the South-West Ward alone there are about 200 babies under 12 months of age placed out with neighbours during the day, and the conditions under which they are cared for is extremely unsatisfactory.
