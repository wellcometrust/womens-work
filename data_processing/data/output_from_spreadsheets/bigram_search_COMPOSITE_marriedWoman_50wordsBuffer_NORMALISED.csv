The rate of mortality of females following industrial occupations cannot be estimated, nor yet, fairly, the average age at death, in consequence of the imperfection of the mortuary returns, which in the instance of married women do not in all cases specify the occupation followed. The particulars as to the cause of death, as given in Table XIV., are open to fewer crbjections on this score. Dressmakers and Milliners appear to die to a large extent from consumption, 42 per cent, of the deaths being attributable to this cause. There is no difficulty in associating this with the damage inflicted upon the health from excessive and late hours of work in close, crowded, and confined rooms, together with deficient bodily exercise.

Female labour is on a very unsatisfactory footing— young women living at home with their parents, certainly earn wages which contribute partly to their maintenance ; some married women work far below the fair value of labour to supplement the wages of a husband whose work is casual and uncertain, often from drunkenness ; female labour even attempts to compete with manufacturing establishments ; some married women again, who erroneously desire to utilize their spare time in working for shops, neglect domestic duties, and thus lower the price of female labour of single women. The worst cases, however, are those of the solitary sempstress, prolonging her hours of work in a small close room, or working by candle light, far into the night, bringing about some debilitating",1870,City of Westminster,"employment,employed,employee,work,working,worked,job,occupation",Yes,,Negative,No,"Retail, Factory, Unspecified"

I have made some enquiries amongst the manufacturers in my district and also amongst the women themselves. I find that the employment of child-bearing women is not very prevalent in large Factories and Workshops. The married women mostly work at home at Boxmaking, Tailoring, or Bootwork. Factory Owners tell me that the proportion of married women among their female hands does not exceed five per cent., and some of these are widows. Occasionally their female hands continue their occupation for a time after marriage, but if they become pregnant they leave the Factory six or eight weeks before the expected confinement.

The majority of the infants are breast fed, at all events for the first few weeks. Only a comparatively small number of mothers in this district go to work regularly and leave their children in charge of others. As there are few factories and laundries in the neighbourhood as compared with other districts further west, married women have limited opportunity of getting work other than as domestic servants or charwomen, so there would appear to be little inducement for them to do so. In some cases, however, mothers, who would otherwise have been able to nurse their infants, were obliged to partially wean them in order to go to work.

The first of these is concerned with the physical well-being of the mother, and is, consequently, a social and economic problem of the first magnitude, towards which there are indications that the State is turning its attention. There can be little doubt but that a considerable proportion of the deaths of infants are due to industrial necessities, and that the employment of married women in factories is responsible for many of the deaths from prematurity and allied conditions. The recent conference on infantile mortality devoted a good deal of attention to this aspect of the question, and passed a resolution-demanding an amendment of the present Factory and Workshops Act, to extend the period during which a factory or workshop shall not ""knowingly"" employ a woman within four weeks after childbirth, to three months.

He took two groups of fifteen towns, each containing respectively the lowest and the highest proportions of occupied married women, and compared their birth rate and infantile mortality in two quinquennia. The birth rate is, as might have been anticipated, lower in the towns having a high proportion of the married women industrially employed. The relationship between industrial employment of married women and infant mortality is however, not very visible.

In order that the Inquiry throughout the country should be of a uniform character, it was decided that investigations should only extend to births registered in 1908; but since it was desirable to complete the records of the first year of life, the enquiry could not be concluded before the end of 1909.

There should be no industrial employment of women before and for some time after childbirth. Indeed it would be to the national advantage if there were no employment of married women who are rearing families. The mother during the period of bearing and nursing the child must be well fed. Willesden has recognised this fact and has provided hot and wholesome mid-day meals for expectant and nursing mothers. 907 such meals were provided during the eight weeks since the Committee last met.

The smaller proportion of females in the age groups 20-39 may be due to young women leaving Woolwich to find employment elsewhere, or to the fact that the London female population at these ages is increased by provincial immigrants who would not be likely to settle in Woolwich where there is very little opportunity for them to find work. This explanation is supported by the fact that, comparatively speaking, there is less female labour employed in Woolwich than in any other Metropolitan Borough, and particularly is this so in the case of married women of whom, approximately, one in twenty is employed compared with one in nine in London as a whole. 14 SECTION II.—VITAL STATISTICS.

Both Hampstead and Lewisham with the lowest rates of infant mortality of the metropolis had higher maternal mortality rates than Shoreditch (with the highest rate of infant mortality). Maternal mortality does not seem to bear much relation to the percentage of married women engaged in extra-domestic duties. In the Metropolitan Boroughs, the lowest mortalities are in those districts which have the highest percentage of married women engaged in some extra-domestic occupation. In last year's report, figures were given showing the position of Acton in this respect. The relationship between these two factors has been discussed, but no definite conclusion can be drawn.

Formerly, extra domestic labour carried on into late pregnancy was supposed to have considerable influence in bringing: about a premature birth. It is quite conceivable that employment of married women in laundries, which involved prolonged periods on their feet and in an upright position would be conducive to premature birth, but such conditions are now rare and in very few instances were the mothers employed in laundries or in any other industrial employment. An examination of the distribution of deaths from prematurity and other pre-natal causes would suggest that extra domestic labour is not now an important factor.

The main aspects of the problem were, therefore, the discovery of defects which existed and the securing of treatment when necessary. In the circular it was suggested that more Nursery Schools might be provided by Education Authorities and more Day Nurseries by Maternity and Child Welfare Authorities. Woolwich had had experience of day nurseries. They were established during the war and extensively used, but immediately after the war they were closed because nobody wanted to use them—no doubt due to the fact that there are relatively fewer married women employed in Woolwich than in any other Borough in London. With this avenue closed, it was necessary to find some other means of approaching the problem, and ultimately it was decided to institute a scheme to provide for the medical inspection of the toddler on similar lines to the medical examination of school children, but making provision for such examination in the third, fourth and fifth year of life. By such a scheme it is hoped to discover defects at least a year or two earlier than they would be discovered by the School Medical Service.

The last facts, and the greater number of married women who are over childbearing age in an older population, account largely for a low birth-rate. The relatively very low proportion of children in the population is due to this low birth-rate, and to the fact that the larger families are particularly apt to move away from Central London. The City offiers much employment to single persons in resident posts as hotel, club or domestic servants, and to married couples without children as caretakers. 17.2 per cent, of the population recorded in the Census were resident in hotels, boarding houses and lodging houses, as compared with 3.6 over the",1932,City of Westminster,"employment,employed,employee,work,working,worked,job,occupation",Yes,,Not applicable/No view,No,Domestic Service

This need for marieed female labour operates in diverse ways: it has its attendant evils as well as its economic advantages to the families concerned. the Day Nursery was established to meet the demands of the married women who worked in the laundries, and from its continued popularity, it shows that the demand still exists. Though Nursery 9 classes have been established, in some of the schools in the neighbourhood, the Day Nursery still works to capacity, and there is always a waiting list.

In some industrial encouragement is given to young married women to return to factories; they are the more experienced and expert workers, and requests are frequently made for their return, especially at rush periods. This is especially true of the laundry industry, but far as our figures go, the same conditions do not apply in the factories in North Acton.

A marked feature of industry during the war years has been the services rendered by married women, who were called upon to assist in the national effort. During the latter part of 1945, there was a visible tendency for married women to leave industry, due no doubt to increasing domestic responsibilities consequent upon the return of evacuee children and men returning home from the Forces.

In this connection a recent report on sickness in a health department of a local authority (published in the ""Monthly Bulletin of the Ministry of Health and the Public Health Laboratory Service"" for October, 1954), is of the greatest interest. It was found that in general women lost more time through illness than men and married women lost more time than a single woman.

As indicated earlier, unlike pneumonia, bronchitis is a disease from which a person may have suffered for many years before death. This is evident from the morbidity statistics produced by the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, based on claims for sickness benefit. Certificates in support of such claims now cover practically the entire employed male population, but they are not so representative of the female population because only married women who follow a paid employment are eligible for national insurance and, of those that are, two.thirds of them ' opt out' of the scheme for sickness benefit. The latest Digest of statistics analysing certificates of incapacity ', relating to 1956.57, show that, for both sexes, bronchitis was one of the two most common causes of sickness absence (for which a claim was made) and was the reason for the highest number of days of absence.

With the greater age of patients the relatives in turn are often in the geriatric age group0 The greater employment of married women has not helped either, in that many of the younger members of the family, friends and neighbours are now not available to help.
